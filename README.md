- 3.05.2016 - I wrote "Hello World"
- 12.05.2016 - Grid layout algorithm. [Variant 1 (the first that came to mind)] (https://github.com/Znbiz/HelikarLab/tree/master/Grid%20layout%20algorithm/Variant%201%20(the%20first%20that%20came%20to%20mind))
- 13.05.2016 - Grid layout algorithm. [Variant 2(The algorithm is taken from the article. The algorithm is very slow)] (https://github.com/Znbiz/HelikarLab/tree/master/Grid%20layout%20algorithm/Variant%202)
- 20.05.2016 - Fixed critical errors in varinte 2
- 27.05.2016 - The integrated function of constructing graph on the grid in the library [ccNetViz] (https://github.com/Znbiz/HelikarLab/tree/master/dist/ccNetViz.js) . Example graph layout [examples/Grid.html] (https://github.com/Znbiz/HelikarLab/tree/master/examples)
- 21.06.2016 - Create Drawing Text with Signed Distance Fields [code] (https://github.com/Znbiz/HelikarLab/tree/master/Generator%20SDF)
- 30.06.2016 - Create Drawing Text with Signed Distance Fields. Using WebGL to calculate SDF. [code] (https://github.com/Znbiz/HelikarLab/tree/master/Generator%20SDF)
- 04.07.2016 - Fixed critical error in the generator SDF. Partially optimized algorithm SDF. Added in the generator SDF: selection size serving of characters of simultaneously processed in the GPU.
- 18.07.2016 - Added to the library ccNetViz display text using SDF.
- 20.07.2016 - Improved text rendering library by using SDF algorithm
- 26.07.2016 - Changed the fragment shader to improve the texture processing SDF
- 29.07.2016 - Added the ability to the library draw the  name tops with different styles using SDF textures
- 2.08.2016  - Added the ability to use the library in advance generated atlases
- 8.08.2016  - Changed method of specifying pre-generated atlases.
