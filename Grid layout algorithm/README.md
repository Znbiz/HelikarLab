# Grid layout algorithm

Each graph node has to be placed in different position of a square grid.
The goal is to choose those positions in such a way that the sum of the length of all graph edges in this layout is minimal.

- Variant 1 (the first that came to mind). I will be used to compare with other algorithms.
